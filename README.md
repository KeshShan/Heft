# Introduction-
This System was originally based on the idea of creating a hybrid system which would be able to compute relational computaiton and graph computation. It's a common logic that any relationships which are represented in tables can be also represented as Nodes and Edges that is graph representation. Both the model (Relational Model and Graph Model) based on the common feature of relationships. Reason to have a hybrid system would be basically
